# SongService
This is an example program I developed to get experience using MongoDB. It demonstrates basic document created and document querying through the following classes: 
* [SongDO.java](https://github.com/dylanjdavidson/SongService/blob/master/src/main/java/com/dylandavidson/service/song/SongDO.java)
* [SongDao.java](https://github.com/dylanjdavidson/SongService/blob/master/src/main/java/com/dylandavidson/service/song/SongDao.java)
* [SongQuery.java](https://github.com/dylanjdavidson/SongService/blob/master/src/main/java/com/dylandavidson/service/song/SongQuery.java)
